It is a quiet night outside the Smith residence.
Inside the residence are some precious artifacts which will set you for life!
However, I've heard that the Smith's have hired a maid to patrol the house.
I would be careful if I were you, the last thief never returned...

Objective:
- Steal as many artifacts until you meet the minimum cash threshold.
- Avoid getting caught by the maid.
- Rendezvous outside once you have met the minimum cash threshold.
