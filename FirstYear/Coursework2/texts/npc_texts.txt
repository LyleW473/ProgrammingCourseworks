That maid is really scary... I'm afraid to move in case she might find me! Who knows what she might do to me...
Sometimes at night, I hear screams... I think its the thieves that got caught stealing! I'm not trying to be one of them...
Ever since the Smiths hired that maid, its become impossible to steal even slippers from this house!
