 *  This class is tbe class for the Player, and contains data relevant to the player.
 *  There are getter methods to modify and retrieve information relevant to the player
 *  as well as "helper" methods that are executed upon a valid command within the Game 
 *  class, for example "dropArtifact" for dropping an artifact out of the player's 
 *  inventory.
 * 
 * It contains the following data:
 *  - The current room the player is in
 *  - History of rooms the player has visited
 *  - Inventory (of collected artifacts)
 *  - Weight of the inventory
 *  - Number of artifacts successfully dropped off (objective).
 *  - The weight limit for the player's inventory.
 * 
 *  The player is created and spawned from within the Game class.
