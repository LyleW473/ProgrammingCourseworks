 *  This class is tbe class for the enemies in my game (i.e., the maids).
 * 
 *  Each enemy has a move interval and counter, and will only move after 
 *  a successful command from the player.
 * 
 *  All enemies are given a defined path to traverse (which is a list of 
 *  Room objects), which is set when all of the Enemy objects are created. 
 *  All traversal paths are cycles, so the maidspatrol a certain area "endlessly".
 * 
 *  Enemies are spawned within the Game class.
