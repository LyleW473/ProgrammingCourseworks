 * 
 *  This class is used to define objects that can hold additional information about the result of a command.
 *  It has been defined because upon a successful command, I wanted to make it so that the command be repeated 
 *  via the "repeat" command as long as the command itself is repeatable. For example, if the player used a 
 *  "help" command followed by a "repeat" command, it should repeat the "help" command again.
 * 
 *  Each CommandResult object will hold boolean attributes, relating to the result of a command created from
 *  the user's input.
 * 
 *  CommandResult objects are created within the user command methods within the Game class.
