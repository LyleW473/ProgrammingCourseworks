 * 
 *  This class is tbe class for the notes in my game, which is the uncollectible item in my 
 *  game.
 * 
 *  Each note has an associated owner (which is just the name of the "owner" of this note)
 *  as well as a text (the contents of the note).
 * 
 *  Notes cannot be collected but they can interacted with as long as the player is in the
 *  same room as the note and the "interact with note" command was used.

 *  All notes are created and spawned from within the Game class using the defined static
 *  methods. (Each created note is randomly assigned an owner from the defined owners and 
 *  texts within this class).
